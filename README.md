# Winamp Client Version Blocker/Locker
This script checks if the mininum set version is the same or newer.

## Note
It is recommended to put it on the first script that is executed on the skin.

## Usage
Include the script and call the function `clientversioning();`

## Client Requirements

Winamp 5.51 or better is required for the script to work.

## Why switch to Winamp Classic?
We change to the Classic Skin because it is intergrated to Winamp, and we know that it is going to work.
